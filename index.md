# About Me

<img src="/images/jasonansel2.png"  class="floatpic">
My name is Jason Ansel. Since 2011, I have been working for the startup [Locu]
([acquired by GoDaddy] in 2013) while also pursuing my PhD at [MIT].
I recently finished my PhD and I am now working full time as the Director
of Machine Learning at GoDaddy.  I was the first non-founder employee of
Locu and my work there focuses on creating machine learning algorithms for
extracting semantic information from unstructured web content.

I spend much of my free time working on [OpenTuner], an extensible framework
for program autotuning.  We are currently looking for users, if interested
the source code is available on the [OpenTuner] site and you can reach me at
`jasonansel@jasonansel.com` with questions.

Earlier at MIT I started the [PetaBricks] language and compiler project.
PetaBricks is a language that incorporates algorithmic choices to allow an
integrated autotuner to explore search spaces of program implementations.
As an undergraduate I did research with [Gene Cooperman] and helped create
[DMTCP], a user-level distributed checkpoint/restart system.
